# voicemsgs-discord
send voice messages using discord.py, u will have to change a few variables like token etc but if you can't do that you shouldn't be trying this lol


few ppl been asking for this voice msg command code, thought I would release it here just for the sake of it, currently untested in gasai as I have ported the code over from my personal sb but everything should work

Note: 
only works in dms, bc u can't send voice messages in guild channels
U will not be able to listen to the voice msgs on mobile, I made a fucky wucky somewhere and really cba trying to fix it lol

how to use:
